# Fractional-Order Control Systems: Tuning Method and Logarithmic Nyquist Diagram

This repository contains Matlab code that can be used to tune fractional-order controllers or integer-order controllers that should control a fractional-order plant. The tuning method is based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and the experimental use of Nyquist's stability criterion for stability assessment. To support the experimental use of Nyquist's stability criterion and to help visualize stability, a matlab function for the plotting of a fractional-order supporting Logarithmic Nyquist Diagram ("Logarithmic-Amplitude Polar Diagram") is provided.
